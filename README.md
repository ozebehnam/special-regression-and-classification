regression and classification with early stopping
Most of the time it comes to overfitting in the training process, one of the ways that can help us to prevent such problems is early stopping. in these two files, you can find out how to use early stopping on regression on a sample using the Boston housing prices dataset and classification on the sample using MNIST handwriting. I hope it will be useful.
